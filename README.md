# MaliciousExtension
A malicious chrome extension written in JavaScript. The extension steals all of the user's cookies, his search history, and reads his C:/Windows directory, sending said information to servers written in NodeJS.

The malicious extension was not written with bad intentions, and will not be used. Feel free to take inspiration, but please do not use it with malicious intent :)
